Did you know that many authors write the ending of their stories first? They often plan how their tale will finish before writing the beginning or middle. This helps them stay focused on the story’s journey and its ultimate goal. A famous example is J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. She knew exactly how the final book would end all the way back in 1990, years before she even published the first book. By imagining the ending early, Rowling could weave hints and clues throughout the series, creating a story full of surprises and connections. Writing the ending first helps authors build a stronger story, as they know where their characters need to go and how everything will come together. It’s like starting a puzzle with the final picture in mind. Next time you read a book, think about how the author might have begun with the ending!
